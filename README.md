# Internationalized fork of Cats of Jasnah
Adapted version of [Cats of Jasnah](https://github.com/countable/cats-of-jasnah), a web based game for learning categories and logic

Now you can play the game in Dutch, or spanish as well (or extend it for your own mother tongue). 

You can currently set the language via an URL param:
```
index.html?lang=es
```

[Play the game](https://ahalma.github.io/cats-of-jasnah/index.html?lang=es)

> I (Clark Van Oyen) made this game for my 3 year old to develop logical language skills. It progresses from counting up to increasingly difficult word problems using boolean logic. This seems like a more intutive path for her to learn at her current level of development and I couldn't find something like this elsewhere.
